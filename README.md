# **Titanium Test Automation Framework**

## **1. Introduction**
The test automation framework was create in order to help technical or non-technical tester to automate their web applications, the main structure is followed by one excel file called DataEngine.xlsx, but if you are a very technical tester, you can use the classes in order to create your own framework or combine with unit testing framework like TestNG or Junit.

When you download the project, you will find, in your DataEngine.xlsx one demo of 3 test cases, you only need to download the object repository and follow the steps in the next chapters the results generated by this framework are:

1. Logs on execution time (console)
2. Log file
3. HTML report
4. Screenshots on error
5. Email on failures
6. Execution video

The knowledge you need to have, if you want to start using this framework, is the web object identification; insomuch as the heart of this framework is Selenium, you need to know how to locate an element, in selenium you will find 8 different ways to do it:

1.	Id 
2.	Name 
3.	Class Name 
4.	Link Text 
5.	Partial Link Text 
6.	Tagname 
7.	Css Selector 
8.	Xpath 

If your object identification is inside these locator types, the framework will be able to identify your object, but don't worry to tell him which is the right locator to use; the framework will find the locator automatically.

Requirements you need in your computer:
- Admin rights on your computer to download and install apps.
- Chocolatey package manager (only windows and optional)
- Homebrew (MAC and optional)
- Java JDK > 1.7
- Maven 3.5.0
- Eclipse Luna or above, IntelliJ or another java IDE.
- Supported browsers as of now: Chrome, IE11 or below, Firefox 46 or below.

## **2. Tools**
the tools and programming language used on this project are:

1. Java as Programming Language
2. Selenium for testing UI elements
3. TestNG as Unit Test Framework
4. Maven as Tool for compiling and execution
5. Git as control version software

## **3. Technology Stack**

### 3.1 Selenium
Selenium automates browsers. That's it! What you do with that power is entirely up to you. Primarily, it is for automating web applications for testing purposes, but is certainly not limited to just that. Boring web-based administration tasks can (and should!) be automated as well.

Selenium has the support of some of the largest browser vendors who have taken (or are taking) steps to make Selenium a native part of their browser. It is also the core technology in countless other browser automation tools, APIs and frameworks.

### 3.2 Java
Java is a general-purpose computer-programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture.

### 3.3 Log4J
log4j is a reliable, fast and flexible logging framework (APIs) written in Java, which is distributed under the Apache Software License. log4j is a popular logging package written in Java. log4j has been ported to the C, C++, C#, Perl, Python, Ruby, and Eiffel languages. 

### 3.4 TestNG
TestNG is a testing framework inspired from JUnit and NUnit but introducing some new functionalities that make it more powerful and easier to use, such as:

- Annotations.
- Run your tests in arbitrarily big thread pools with various policies available (all methods in their own thread, one thread per test class, etc...).
- Test that your code is multithread safe.
- Flexible test configuration.
- Support for data-driven testing (with @DataProvider).
- Support for parameters.
- Powerful execution model (no more TestSuite).
- Supported by a variety of tools and plug-ins (Eclipse, IDEA, Maven, etc...).
- Embeds BeanShell for further flexibility.
- Default JDK functions for runtime and logging (no dependencies).
- Dependent methods for application server testing.

TestNG is designed to cover all categories of tests:  unit, functional, end-to-end, integration, etc... 

### 3.5 Extent Reports
Extent Report is a HTML reporting library for Selenium WebDriver for Java which is to a great degree simple to use and makes excellent execution reports. We can use this tool within our TestNG automation framework. As an automation tester its obligation to catch great reporting and present to administration group.

### 3.6 Apache POI
A project run by the Apache Software Foundation, and previously a sub-project of the Jakarta Project, provides pure Java libraries for reading and writing files in Microsoft Office formats, such as Word, PowerPoint and Excel.

### 3.7 Maven
Apache Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information. 

## **4. Steps to Execute**

### 4.1 Installing Java, Maven and Git
If you have installed Java (1.8 or above) and Maven (3.5 or above), skip this section

**Windows**

## **6. Setting the Execution**

### **6.1 Config File**

1. Open config.properties file previously downloaded.
2. you can indicate to open the html report, logs and data engine files automatically after the execution is completed, if you don't want to open one or more files when the execution is completed, you need to set the value as false.
3. In the second section, you can indicate the name of your data engine file you can create multiple engine files or only one.
5. In Object Repository property, you need to indicate the name of your repository file (if you want to include one), by default the name is ObjRep.txt.
6. The last part is the email info, if you want to send email on error; you need to set the variable SendEmail as true, Host variable need to indicate the mail protocol you will use. SmtpPort is the port where you are able to send the email, in From and Password variables you need to indicate your email credentials and the last variable is To, you need to add the email direction you want to send the email.

2. Go to Test Cases tab and fill column Test Case ID (mandatory field) with the name of your test case.
3. Fill with a brief description on Description column.
4. Run column will define if the specified test case will be executed or no (Yes or No flag)
5. DDT Sheet column will let you define if the test itâ€™s going to be Data Driven, you need to add the sheet name for that specific test case, note: you can create all data sheets you want in this file.
6. Result column will fill after the test is done with the result.

*Remember, the object placed into your pages, need to be the same you have in your object repository.*

8. Save your excel sheet and close the file.
If you donâ€™t want to use the Page Object Model into data engine file, you can hide the column Page Name and paste the objects locators directly into your *Page Object* column.
